# CRM-Application-for-Jewel-Management
I built a CRM Application for Jewellery Management in Salesforce to manage inventory, customers, and orders. It includes custom objects, formulas, validation rules, flows, and email alerts. Reports and dashboards track top-selling items, revenue trends, and low stock, offering a complete CRM solution.
